This is a test for creating a searchable data dictionary for CADRE-Cambridge in the format of a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. 

CADRE is a data-initiative led by Dr Anna Moore and facilitated by the TIMELY Research Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge. It is a network of local databases that are linked together, and it has been designed purely for childrenâ€™s health research, innovation and service improvement.

The first CADRE is currently in development in Cambridge. We have partnered with NIHR Mental Health Translational Research Collaboration Mental Health Mission (NIHR MH-TRC MHM) to bring CADREs to other parts of the UK and help researchers understand and support the mental health needs of children and young people.
